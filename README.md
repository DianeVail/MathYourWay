This is my capstone project for CODE:You. 

This Project was created to help students easily find resources for math class without having to navigate between resources and to eliminate the need for multiple log in credentials.  There is a lot of room for growth on this project to include additional code for calculating a wide range of math topics for all grade levels.  The goal of the project is to demonstrate a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This project utilizes the following resources:

 - Numbers API
 - Geogebra API
 - Geogebra.org
 - KhanAcademy.org
 - SchoolYourself.org

This poject uses an API to list an intersting fact of the day everytime the page is visited.  It includes an app to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Users will input values to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem.  The app tests the input for valid data and outputs an error if necessary.  This project also includes an app that calculates the solutions to a Quadratic Equation and outputs the x-intercepts and end-behavior of the graph.  If the user enters a linear equation it outputs the properties of the line created.  Both of these apps include links to the appropriate graphing software.  

**Goals of this Project**

 - Demonstrate my current knowledge of responsive web design
 - Demonstrate my current knowledge of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality
 - Demonstrate my current knowledge of incorporating restful APIs

**Code:YOU Feature Requirements**

1.  **Launch Page**

    Requirements included: Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
    
2.  **Pythagorean Theorem Calculator**
   
    Requirements included:  - Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.
                            - Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it.
                     
3.  **Geogebra Geometry Page**
   
     Requirements included: Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
    
4.  **Algebraic Function Evaluator**

    Requirements included: Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.
    
5.  **Geogebra Graphing Calculator Page**

    Requirements included: Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
